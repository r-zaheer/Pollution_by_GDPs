# Identifying Pollution relationship with GDP size 
It's my UMICH masters program project completed in Winters 2023 session. The goal was to identify the relationship of pollution with the size of GDPs of countries.
My analysis focused on Top 5 GDPs and that lead to a generalized conclusion for each counties. 

## Key Findings

Pollution has a downword trending in developed nations. Developing nations mostly shows increasing pollution trends. 
Nepal has an intersting trend
Maybe it's being penalized becuase it's sandwiched between the two highly polluted countries India and China. 
More Analysis is needed to validate.
